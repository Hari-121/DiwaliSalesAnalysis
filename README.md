# Customer Insights and Sales Improvement

## Project Overview
This project involves using Python for comprehensive data analysis to improve customer experience and sales. The analysis focuses on data cleaning and manipulation, exploratory data analysis (EDA) using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. Key insights are generated to identify potential customers across different states, occupations, genders, and age groups.

## Objectives
- **Data Cleaning and Manipulation**: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct data types to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Generate visualizations to uncover patterns, trends, and insights within the data.
- **Customer Experience Improvement**: Identify potential customers based on various demographics and improve sales strategies.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Programming language used for analysis.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and cleaned data files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step analysis.
- `reports/`: Generated reports and visualizations.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data cleaning, manipulation, and EDA.

## Data Analysis Process

### 1. Data Cleaning and Manipulation
- Handle missing values.
- Remove duplicates.
- Correct data types.
- Filter and sort data.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize data using histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots.
- Analyze customer demographics across states, occupations, genders, and age groups.
- Identify trends and patterns in customer behavior.

### 3. Insights and Recommendations
- Identify potential customers based on demographics.
- Provide actionable insights to improve sales strategies.
- Recommend targeted marketing efforts to enhance customer experience.

## Results
- Improved understanding of customer demographics and behavior.
